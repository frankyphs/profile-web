          <p className="lead">
            From July 2019 to October 2019, I had the opportunity to work at PT.
            Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd. at a palm fruit processing factory
            producing Crude Palm Oil located in Berau, East Kalimantan. I held
            the position of Trainee Mill with the prospect of becoming an
            assistant manager. However, due to certain circumstances, I was
            unable to continue the program. Despite working for only three
            months at PT. KLK Indonesia, I had various responsibilities and
            tasks, including:
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            ● Supervised the performance of operators at 3 stations (sterilizer
            station, kernel processing station, and pressing station) at Berau
            Palm Oil Mill (Capacity: 80 tons/hour).
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            ● Analyzed recurring issues at the sterilizer and kernel stations
            and provided input/ideas for improvement to the Mill Manager (e.g.,
            frequent oil leakage in the sterilizer tank).
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            ● Conducted audits of oil output from the 3 main stations
            (sterilizer stations, press station, and kernel station).
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            In addition, I gained valuable non-technical skills, such as:
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            1. Communicating with individuals with limited educational
            backgrounds.
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            2. Problem-solving to quickly resolve issues, as problems sometimes
            arose at the factory during the night.

            After that, I had the opportunity to work at PT. Adika Mitra Sehati
            (Siemens Local Distributor) from November 2020 to January 2023. This
            job aligns with my educational background in instrumentation and
            control. I was able to apply my knowledge and understanding
            extensively in this role. Additionally, I was expected to have a
            comprehensive understanding of all Siemens products from various
            perspectives, including electrical aspects, working principles,
            installation and commissioning, as well as functionality.
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            My responsibilities and tasks during this employment were as
            follows:
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            ● Conducted testing and commissioning of flowmeters, pressure
            transmitters, level transmitters, and temperature transmitters of
            various Siemens Germany brands at user/client sites, ensuring smooth
            operation of all devices.
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            ● Conducted surveys and analysis to identify user’s requirements for
            centralized automation systems, including PLC (Controller) Siemens
            S7-1200, sensors, and other required electrical components.
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            ● Designed and configured centralized automation systems based on
            user specifications using Siemens software, and created Bill of
            Quantities (BOQ) based on the configuration results.
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            The most challenging aspect of working here was when I was asked to
            perform tests and commissioning on Siemens products that I hadn`t
            encountered before. It required careful reading of the product`s
            manual book in order to successfully carry out the tasks.
